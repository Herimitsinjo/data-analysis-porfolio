# Data Preprocessing Project

## Analyzing borrowers’ risk of defaulting

### 1. Project description

This project is to prepare a report for a bank’s loan division. I need to find out if a customer’s marital status and number of children has an impact on whether they will default on a loan. If you want to see the code right away, click [link to the project code!](https://github.com/Herimitsinjo/data-analysis-porfolio1/blob/main/Analysis%20and%20identification%20of%20the%20creditworthy%20clients.ipynb)

The bank already has some data on customers’ credit worthiness. This report will be considered when building a credit scoring of a potential customer. A credit scoring is used to evaluate the ability of a potential
borrower to repay their loan.

### 2. Data description

* *children* — the number of children in the family
* *days_employed* — how long the customer has worked
* *dob_years* — the customer’s age
* *education* — the customer’s education level
* *education_id* — identifier for the customer’s education
* *family_status* — the customer’s marital status
* *family_status_id* — identifier for the customer’s marital status
* *gender* — the customer’s gender
* *income_type* — the customer’s income type
* *debt* — whether the client has ever defaulted on a loan
* *total_income* — annual income
* *purpose* — reason for taking out a loan

### 3. Questions to be answered

After dealing with missing values, duplicated values, unmatched data types, and categorizing data, the followings are the questions that need to be answered:

* Is there a connection between having kids and repaying a loan on time?
* Is there a connection between marital status and repaying a loan on time?
* Is there a connection between income level and repaying a loan on time?
* How do different loan purposes affect timely loan repayment?
